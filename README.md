This process was close to the most lengthly. No national databases exists for gun deaths. The gaps in the data are everywhere. The NRA has consistenly opposed a database of gun owners in the US. Until recently, the CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System—the best database on firearm deaths available—had data from only 18 states. Collecting the data is expensive, and states report it voluntarily. Because of this issue, I collaborated with UW epidemiologist, Frederick Rivara, for insight in where to begin my epxloration with American gun data. He was featured in a Wired article talking about the lack of avaialble gun data in America (http://www.wired.com/2015/10/america-still-doesnt-good-data-guns/). By and far the most comprehensive database out there is the Gun Violence Archive creatd by Mark Bryant (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/23/kentucky-gun-owner-gun-violence-archive-mark-bryant). The toruble is making any declarations of trends or correlaitons with the crowdsourced datasets. Although these projects proclaim to be as impartial and data-driven as possible, view the data with skepticism.
